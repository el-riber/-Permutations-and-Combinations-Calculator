# ðŸ“Š Permutations and Combinations Calculator

This Python terminal application calculates **P(n, r)** (permutations) and **C(n, r)** (combinations) based on user input.

## ðŸ”¢ What It Does

- Accepts two inputs:  
  - `n`: total items  
  - `r`: items to be chosen or arranged
- Calculates:
  - **P(n, r)** = number of permutations
  - **C(n, r)** = number of combinations
- Handles invalid or edge case inputs with clear error messages

---

## âœ… Example

```bash
Enter n (total items): 5
Enter r (items to choose or arrange): 3

Permutation P(5, 3) = 60
Combination C(5, 3) = 10
